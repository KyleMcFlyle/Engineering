            <p>9/23/22 This week, Me and my group designed a Rube Goldberg Machine. We made a CAD of our Machine as well. The Image for both are Below:</p>

            <p>Unfortunatly I do not have my own CAD, the CAD image is my Groups. I was absent for a week from school during the CADing process. However, I have a video showing the project at work, in slow motion! The Video is below:</p>

            <p>10/21/22 This week, we made a bom, and a rocket that looked pretty cool but did not fly as well as thought out to have. However, we did also learn about what makes a rocket fly, how to make a roket, and how to use a water and compressed air mixture to fire a rocket. We also learned the better designing to a rocket to make the longest flight. Small Body and small wings, so it is light weight and also has some aerodynamics. Here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jQm3xW3jTuA78BLt9EeqPO5uJ4YD-bmk/view?usp=sharing"> PDF File</a> for you to look at! Here is the image of our Rocket:

            <p>11/4/22 The first week of November, and we're starting to learn Electrical Engineering! Foe the next 3 weeks we're goingt to be working with Bead Boards and Wires and other electrical components. This past week however, Though being absent on Wednesday, We Used TinkerCad again To use the Circut Option. We were making LEDs light up and such. Below is a screenshot of A successful circut and a failed circut.</p>

            <p>11/10/22 New Week, New update. This week, we started breadboarding with actual circuts. We lit up an LED and measured voltage with a multimeter. Below are pictures of the circut we made.</p>

            <p>Another thing I did this week on Challange day was come up with an Idea on how to prevent people from contracting cancer from lake water. I sketched filtration devices under the water and a fence to keep people out.

            <p>12/15/22 Over the past 3 weeks, we have been working on our final project. The basic premis is to make a bridge out of spagetti. We get 20 pieces to use for the finished product. Unfortunatly, Diego and I were put into a seperate group from our original one due to issues with participation. Unfortunatly I do not have a picture or video of the Project, and I apologize for that.</p>

            <p>1/13/23 A new Year, and a new week of Engineering Class. This week, we started business engineering, and we are making a presentation as if we went on Shark Tank. We (as in Me and Auggie) Have made the Premium Ultra Motivational Reusable Pen. Basically, It's a Pen and a Pencil, which splits to show an interchangable Ink Cartridge, and the Pencil uses 3 different kinds of Led. 0.5mm, 0.7mm, and 1.2mm. It comes with an eraser that erases both pen and Pencil, and it also has extra coloured cartridges, more than 10 Colours. Here is a photo of the design:</p>

            <p>1/19/23 It's time for another update! This week, we did our presentations for Business Engineering. The "offer" we took was $680k for 18%. We'll get a grade some Time in the Future, but for now, here is a YouTube Video I posted. Until next update!</p>

            <p>1/27/23- Another Update! We made Oobleck, a material that is both liquid and solid at the same time. More force, harder it gets. Less force, the softer and more liquidy it stays. Here are some Images of what it looked like.</p>

            <p>2/3/23 I was absent this week, so this update is being typed on the 6th. Last week, I Began the Cadding process for my Mousetrap Car. I finished the Cad today since I was absent the week it was due. I went absent on Thursday and Friday. Either way, Here is a picture of my Cad Design!</p>

            <p>2/10/23 A new week means new things finished. So far, My mousetrap car prototype is coming along nicely. I've got done the base, and just need to add a few more things onto it. Below are some Images of the car.</p>

            <p> For Challange day, we had to create a contraption to hold a water balloon and carry it safely accross an area while moving as fast as possible. Below is the attached, totally very detailed PDF, and a Video of our ptoject.</p>

            <p>2/17/23 It is Friday! No school Monday this week or last week. This week, I finished my first prototype of the Mousetrap Car. Below this text is a video of the test.</p>

            <p>Although it was slow, It's a big step towards the final project. Very cool.</p>

        <center>
            <p>2/24/23 This week, I continued working on my Mousetrap Car. I disassembled my first prototype to make what I thought would be Prototype 2, but it's going to be my Finale Product as the project is due on Thursday next week. The only difference about this one is a sturdier frame and the wheels aren't far apart anymore. A drawing is on the bottem to symbolize the project is mine (plus my name), and It will be finished within a couple days. Going into the future, I don't plan to change much else other than maybe sturdying the frame more than it is. My goal is to hopefully have it go a few feet without stopping. Next Week I'll have the finished product photos.</p>

            <p>3/3/23 Over the past 6 weeks, I've been working on building a MouseTrap Car. Over that time, I've created 4 protoypes, which only 2 worked. One of them didn't move, and the last one, which was supposed to be my Finale Design, was left unfinished the day of the contest of Car racing. Over these last 6 weeks however, I've learned some important things for future projects I work on. Not only material conservation, but also time conservation/management, and planning ahead. Some things that happened out of my control were being sick, and also Non-School Days. Getting back on track, because my car was unfinished, I ended up grouping with Theo, a friend of mine. He was almost finished with the car, and I helped him get it almost complete. Unfortunatly, we didn't finish it, and as a result of a missing string and some missing glue, the car only moved a few inches. Below is an Image of the final product on display, and the 2 videos we took for the car.</p>

            <p>04/14/2023 - This update is talking about one of our last projects. Over the Next few weeks, and the last couple weeks, My Team, consisting of Theo, Auggie, Ayaan, and Siuneh, Are working on a cardboard boat, capable of holding two people, that will float across the pool at CV. Below is a screenshot of the CAD for our project. We currently do not have a picture of the boat yet, but will within the next couple weeks.</p>

            <p>05/04/2023 Update - We tested our boat yesterday. It turned out pretty poorly. The biggest reason was the little amount of tape we had, so as pressure was put down in the center of the boat, the water seeped through the non taped areas. For future reference, we should add enough tape so that there are no open areas, so when conserving tape, do so with the rest of the boat and go all out on the base so we don't have another leekage. Below is a video of the boat.</p>

            <p>05/15/2023 Update - New boat progress and challange day! For our boat we're going somewhat with the old design, pictured in earlier website posts, and for challange day, we're making a paper roller coaster. In order to get points, we need loops, lengthy pieces, and it must look good. Below is an image of the roller coaster but it isn't nice looking and fails lmao.</p>

            <p>05/22/23 Update - Last week (since today is Monday), we worked more on the boat. We've got one of the "capsuls" ready, and we're making the other one. I'll have pictures up next website update, so Friday/Monday next week. Our plan is to make the base as sturdy as possible in order to keep water from getting in. The walls aren't that tall, but shoulld still keep water outside. I was absent Friday so I am not entirely sure what was done, but I'm sure it was good.</p>
