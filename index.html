            8/19/2022 Today I Have Officially Learned How to Make a Starting Website
            For My Engineering Class
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>9/2/2022 This week, I have started using <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/">TinkerCad</a> for 3D Modeling!
        I have also successfully learned how to 3D Model with Basic Shapes</p>

<p>9/23/22 This week, Me and my group designed a Rube Goldberg Machine. We made a CAD of our Machine as well. The Image for both are Below:</p>

            <p>Unfortunatly I do not have my own CAD, the CAD image is my Groups. I was absent for a week from school during the CADing process. However, I have a video showing the project at work, in slow motion! The Video is below:</p>

        <p>9/30/22 A new week means a new update. This past week, I CADed a new Project, that being a prostetic limb for an animal! I hose a horse. Below is an image of my CAD.</p>

<p>10/21/22 This week, we made a bom, and a rocket that looked pretty cool but did not fly as well as thought out to have. However, we did also learn about what makes a rocket fly, how to make a roket, and how to use a water and compressed air mixture to fire a rocket. We also learned the better designing to a rocket to make the longest flight. Small Body and small wings, so it is light weight and also has some aerodynamics. Here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jQm3xW3jTuA78BLt9EeqPO5uJ4YD-bmk/view?usp=sharing"> PDF File</a> for you to look at! Here is the image of our Rocket:

            <p>11/4/22 The first week of November, and we're starting to learn Electrical Engineering! Foe the next 3 weeks we're goingt to be working with Bead Boards and Wires and other electrical components. This past week however, Though being absent on Wednesday, We Used TinkerCad again To use the Circut Option. We were making LEDs light up and such. Below is a screenshot of A successful circut and a failed circut.</p>

            <p>11/10/22 New Week, New update. This week, we started breadboarding with actual circuts. We lit up an LED and measured voltage with a multimeter. Below are pictures of the circut we made.</p>

            <p>Another thing we did was convince whether or not you would want to take a math class for a full school year or write from number 1-1,000,000. The</p> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NoftAum8rt3mTyisgiD3Vh8Wl8oubw4b/view?usp=share_link"> PDF File</a> <p>for you to view.</p>

            <p>11/18/22 For this week, we continued Breadboarding, but we started using the Arduino Website to code our Arduino boards. We Coded different LEDs to blink seperatly and together every 1000 milliseconds. Below are some Images of the LED Lights, The Code and a Video</p>

            <p>Another thing I did this week on Challange day was come up with an Idea on how to prevent people from contracting cancer from lake water. I sketched filtration devices under the water and a fence to keep people out.

            <p>12/15/22 Over the past 3 weeks, we have been working on our final project. The basic premis is to make a bridge out of spagetti. We get 20 pieces to use for the finished product. Unfortunatly, Diego and I were put into a seperate group from our original one due to issues with participation. Unfortunatly I do not have a picture or video of the Project, and I apologize for that.</p>

            <p>1/13/23 A new Year, and a new week of Engineering Class. This week, we started business engineering, and we are making a presentation as if we went on Shark Tank. We (as in Me and Auggie) Have made the Premium Ultra Motivational Reusable Pen. Basically, It's a Pen and a Pencil, which splits to show an interchangable Ink Cartridge, and the Pencil uses 3 different kinds of Led. 0.5mm, 0.7mm, and 1.2mm. It comes with an eraser that erases both pen and Pencil, and it also has extra coloured cartridges, more than 10 Colours. Here is a photo of the design:</p>

            <p>1/19/23 It's time for another update! This week, we did our presentations for Business Engineering. The "offer" we took was $680k for 18%. We'll get a grade some Time in the Future, but for now, here is a YouTube Video I posted. Until next update!</p>
